# README of a project

A readme has several goals:

It should

1. explain the purpose of the project
2. show how the project can be used
3. some kind of _getting started_ for an introduction, with installation instructions if needed


## What Else

A readme is usually written in MarkDown a WYSIWYM (what you see is what you mean) language as opossed e.g. Word which is WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get).

MarkDown is widespread and virtually every git host offers MarkDown rendering on the website (github, gitlab, azure devops to mention some big ones).
