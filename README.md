# APPI - Intermediate Python Course


## Solutions

The solution to the tiny_raytracer can be found within `tiny_raytracer/src`. 

# Capstone Project (`tiny_raytracer`)

The idea of the capstone project is based on tinyraytracer, a 256 line C++ ray-tracer - rewritten in Python [tinyraytracer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyraytracer).

It uses a scene description of materials, spheres and lights and uses this scene to render an image based on the law of physics (diffuse light, ambient light, reflection, refraction).

The key class is the `Vector` class. Even though there is no heritance involved it shows many of the overload methods like `__add__`, `__sub__`.

Implementing the `Vector` functions is the primary exercise of the first course. Once all unit tests (contained in `test_vector.py`) succeed it should be safe to continue.
