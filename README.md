# APPI - Intermediate Python Course

This is my try at contributing to APPI

## chapters

Contains a folder for each chapter for this course. Each subfolder contains at least a `README.md`. Other files might be example source code related to the chapter.

## src (tbd)

This folder will contain Python source files. Potentially with subfolders like `examples` for particular examples.



## Powerpoint

The presentation is shared here: https://1drv.ms/p/s!AlQXFUn0ctPihfpVTOoC7x7xzudaPA?e=rvk7Mc
